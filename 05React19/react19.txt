Features of React19
- own compier
- no longer worry for memorization
- own metadata system for SEO optimization, no longer need library like react-helmet
- directive system, no longer need library like react-router (use client and use server)
- built-in state management, no longer need library like redux or mobx
- built-in data fetching, no longer need library like react-query or swr
- built-in form handling, no longer need library like formik or react-hook-form
- server components, no longer need library like next.js or remix
- improve hydration, streaming, suspense, and concurrent features for better performance and user experience

New & Improved Hooks
React 19 adds several new hooks for modern app needs:
- useActionState – Handles action state (pending, success, error) cleanly.
- useFormStatus – Lets child components access the parent form’s status.
- useOptimistic – Built-in support for optimistic UI updates.
- useDeferredValue – Defers non-urgent UI updates for better responsiveness.
- (Optional) useEvent – Stable event handler hook that avoids re-creation on every render.
- React 19 also includes a new experimental use() API that can read async values (e.g. promises) directly in components.

NO LONGER NEED
- forwardRef which is used to pass refs through components, now React 19 has built-in support for refs without needing this helper.
- memo which is used to optimize functional components by memoizing their output, now React 19
- lazy and Suspense which are used for code-splitting and lazy loading components, now React 19 has built-in support for these features without needing these helpers.
- useContext which is used to access context values in functional components, now React 19 has built-in support for context without needing this hook.
- memo and useMemo which are used to optimize performance by memoizing values and functions, now React 19 has built-in support for memoization without needing these helpers.
- useCallback which is used to memoize callback functions, now React 19 has built-in
- useEffect which is used to perform side effects in functional components, now React 19 has built-in support for side effects without needing this hook.

React 19 use Hook
- use() is used as async data handling, it can read promises directly
- instead of using useContext, we can now pass use(context) directly in the component to access context values

Actions in React 19
- async functions for simple form actions, can utilize on server and client

useFormStatus Hook
- gives information about last submission status.
- can be used to disable submit button while form is submitting, show success or error messages, etc.
- can be used in child components to access parent form status, allowing for better component composition and separation of concerns.
const {pending, data, method, action} = useFormStatus();


useActionState
- update state based on the status of an action (pending, success, error)
- can be used to show loading indicators, success messages, error messages, etc. based on the status of an action.
const [state, formAction] = useActionState(fn, initialState);

useTransition
- used to manage transitions between different states in a component, such as loading states or UI updates.
- can be used to show a loading indicator while a component is transitioning to a new state, and then update the UI once the transition is complete.
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
