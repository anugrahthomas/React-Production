TYPESCRIPT:
- A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.

Features:
- Static Typing: Allows developers to define variable types, enabling type checking at compile time.
- Interfaces: Define custom types and enforce structure on objects.
- Classes: Supports object-oriented programming with classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.
- Generics: Enables the creation of reusable components that work with various data types.
- Modules: Supports modular programming by allowing code to be organized into separate files and namespaces.
- Type Inference: Automatically infers types based on the assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
- Decorators: Provides a way to add metadata to classes and methods, often used in frameworks like Angular.
- Advanced Type Features: Includes union types, intersection types, tuple types, and type aliases for more complex type definitions.
- Tooling Support: Excellent integration with IDEs and build tools, providing features like autocompletion, refactoring, and error checking.
